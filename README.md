# Introduction

This is a beginner's notebook on Neural Networks, to implement what I applied in this amazing course from MIT http://introtodeeplearning.com/, which I highly recommend to check out. Our goal is to recognize digits from images, to do so we will use Convolutional Neural Networks, which are powerful tools for Computer Vision problems.
